        <p>Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing two or three windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished.</p>

        <p>"Here they are!" shouted a man in a blue jersey.  "Yonder! D'yer see them?  Yonder!"</p>

        <p>Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured Martians appeared, far away over the little trees, across the flat meadows that stretched towards Chertsey, and striding hurriedly towards the river.  Little cowled figures they seemed at first, going with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds.</p>

        <p>Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth.  Their armoured bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the guns, growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer.  One on the extreme left, the remotest that is, flourished a huge case high in the air, and the ghostly, terrible Heat-Ray I had already seen on Friday night smote towards Chertsey, and struck the town.</p>

        <p>At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowd near the water's edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck. There was no screaming or shouting, but a silence.  Then a hoarse murmur and a movement of feet--a splashing from the water.  A man, too frightened to drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung round and sent me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden.  A woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me.  I turned with the rush of the people, but I was not too terrified for thought.  The terrible Heat-Ray was in my mind.  To get under water! That was it!</p>

        <p>"Get under water!" I shouted, unheeded.</p>
